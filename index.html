        <h2>Stay focused on the bout</h2>

        <p>When you're directing an intense bout, you don't want to have to think about anything besides the bout. You already need to keep your attention on so many different things--why add another? 
          En Garde lets you devote full attention to the bout thanks to haptic feedback, audio cues, and a large UI. It displays a toast message every time you perform an action, so you know exactly what you just did. 
          You can even undo your previous actions to correct for any mistakes!</p>
