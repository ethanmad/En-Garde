FencingScorekeeper
==================

En Garde is the first fencing scorekeeping app built with a focus on simplicity, design, and ease-of-use. Tired of juggling a stopwatch, pencil, and clipboard all while directing an important bout? En Garde shrinks all of those tools down into something you can fit into the cup of your hand.
I realized the need for such an app when a referee at a local tournament came to me asking how to use the scorekeeping app he had just downloaded. I, of course, had no idea either, so I decided to make a new scorekeeping app that anyone can use.
